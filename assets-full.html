    ambition of what they are doing, and resources that development period. It
    is obvious that Collective is very successful at doing this... I was
    treated with respect and enthusiasm, and the work Collective did for me

    <strong>Art in Action: Artists’ Case Studies</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Deadline: April</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Scottish Contemporary Art Network
</p>
<p>
    In a harsh financial climate and a moment of continued review, we want to
    raise awareness among policymakers of the fragility of the visual arts
    sector, the myriad pressures upon it and the huge contribution we make.
</p>
<p>
    In support of our ongoing Art in Action campaign, we are looking to
    commission case studies of contemporary artists making a living in the
    field. Having successfully launched in May 2019, SCAN initially identified
    seven case studies to showcase ground-breaking sector activity. SCAN is
    using the case studies to better tell the story of contemporary visual arts
    in Scotland, reinforcing understanding of the important role that art
    organisations and artists are playing right across civic life and
    evidencing the impact to policy-makers.
</p>
<p>
    The case studies will be shared directly with key policy-maker contacts as
    part of our second year of campaigning, as well as on the SCAN website,
    across other platforms like press/radio and at SCAN’s public events. The
    participating artists can also use the content created for their own use.
</p>
<p>
    To aid in gathering the material for the case studies, we are working with
    BOP Consulting, who will hold phone interviews with the successful artists
    in early June, and then work directly with them towards tailoring the
    online content. For examples of previous case studies, please visit the Art
    in Action blog www.action.art.blog/case-studies/. We hope to launch this
    second phase of case studies in July 2020.
</p>
<p>
    This is a paid opportunity, and we will reimburse artists for two days of
    work at our regular day-rate of £175. Please send us a cover letter (1 A4
    page max) indicating why you would be interested in this opportunity, and a
    short CV (2 A4 pages max) to demonstrate your professional experience.
    Deadline for submissions is midnight, 20 April 2020. Please send your
    applications to info@sca-net.org.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        We respect and value the diverse and powerful contribution that art and
        artists make to our society, culture and economy
    </li>
    <li>
        We believe that art is vital for the health and wellbeing of
        individuals and society
    </li>
    <li>
        We recognise that artists inspire agency and change within their
        communities and they play an essential role in public life.
    </li>
    <li>
        We call upon policymakers to place culture at the heart of
        representative policy and decision-making.
    </li>
    <li>
        We call for longer term public investment that supports the creative
        and professional development of artists, workers and organisations.

    Edinburgh.

    The fund enables and empowers artists to make improvements to the local

    quality, enjoyment, and making these areas more desirable to live in. Over

    developments, and the ongoing business and cultural development on Leith
    Walk in association with Edinburgh University have been particularly
    successful projects.

    talent, entrepreneurship, and supporting new housing schemes. It also
    encourages communities to participate in shaping their local environment
    and increase their levels of physical activity.
</p>

    the local community and to devise a site-specific work that responds to the
    burgeoning regeneration of these neighbourhoods.

<p>
    <strong>MA Applied Art and Social Practice</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Deadline: July</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Queen Margaret University Edinburgh
</p>
<p>
    A 1-year programme (or 2 yrs PT) for creative practitioners or recent
    graduates wanting enhance their theoretical and practical skills when
    working with communities.
</p>
<p>
    This is the second year of a recently offered course, now recruiting for
    its September 2021 cohort.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With growing interest in applied arts and social practice, this MA will
    allow students to graduate with a better understanding of how artists,
    theatre practitioners and other creatives apply their skills in social
    contexts, third sector organisations, public health, social welfare,
    education and criminal justice, while giving them the practical and
    enterprise skills to develop a sustainable career in their chosen field.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The combination of modules on this MA makes it unique in Scotland. The
    flexible study options and diverse curriculum make it particularly suitable
    if you are already working in the sector or wish to do so while studying.
    The programme may be studied in one year full-time or up to seven years on
    a part-time basis. Course fees for the MA Applied Art and Social Practice
    course is £2,900.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The unique focus of this course is on the *practice* of working with
    communities in Applied Arts contexts, and thus aims to ensure students gain
    knowledge in real time contexts alongside communities and organisations
    alongside theoretical considerations. Industry-based learning opportunities
    (i.e. 'placements') are available and the final dissertation of the MA
    would be a community-based project either in partnership with our local or
    national partners, or with a community of your choosing.

    <strong>Call for Papers – Performing the North / South</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Deadline: August</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Special Issue <em>Scottish Journal of Performance Vol. 6 (2)</em>
</p>
<p>
    Deadline for Proposal: July 20 2020
</p>
<p>
    This themed issue of the <em>Scottish Journal of Performance</em> will
    focus on relations between North and South in performance practice and
    theatre studies. The journal presents an open access platform for
    performance researchers based in Scotland, and for all scholars writing
    about theatre and performance in relation to Scotland. In this tenth issue
    the editors wish to interrogate the geographical perspective of the journal
    and the political implications of that perspective for a voice for critical
    art-making in the so-called Global North: we wish to reinforce the position
    of the <em>Scottish Journal of Performance</em> in the fight against
    embedded inequality and racism in educational institutions and communities.
    This edition is open to any international arts practitioner, or scholar
    investigating the performing of North / South, who wishes to contribute to
    this discourse.
</p>
<p>
    Geopolitical and cultural codings of North and South continue to haunt our
    critical views of the world and its cultural representations. Glasgow-based
    historian Benjamin White has remarked on the dominant mode to refer to the
    ‘US-Mexican’ border when scholars analyse undocumented migration across the
    Arizona desert. This is telling insofar as ‘it shows where they (we) are
    looking at that border from: the US’, from the North (2019). This special
    issue seeks to challenge such predominant modes of looking ‘from the North
    onto the South’ and asks about the usefulness of the ‘North-South’ concept.
</p>
<p>
    At the same time we ask ourselves why is decolonisation becoming more
    popular among academics of the ‘Global North’ <em>now</em>, and what are
    possible pitfalls? What are the crucial differences in the meaning of
    decolonisation for postcolonial spaces in the North and South? Can Scotland
    legitimately be considered as one of the colonized nations of the Global
    North?
</p>
<p>
    What Stuart Hall stated ten years ago in conversation with Les Back now
    seems more acute than ever:
    <em>
        Britain will never go back to being a culturally homogeneous society
        ever again. It can’t. I mean it can have purges, it can throw people
        into the sea. It can enforce assimilation but it can’t go back to being
        stable and steady on its own mono-cultural foundations.
    </em>
    (2009).
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, we encourage a variety of Northern / Southern, in-between and
    hybrid voices in this special issue. We welcome proposals which work
    through the positionality of the author(s), and might not easily fit given
    epistemologies; proposals which name and contest cultural, racial,
    class-based and geopolitical borders and stay vigilant about how cultural
    values, aesthetics and other representational regimes continue to reproduce
    colonial structures.
</p>
<p>
    Please send 250–350 word proposals plus a 100 word bio for articles,
    interviews, practice-as-research essays or provocations that attend to the
    performing of North / South. The journal also welcomes multi-media
    submissions.

</p>
<p>
    A committee role at EMBASSY is a voluntary position that lasts for a
    maximum of two years, with the committee consisting of 5-7 members at any
    given time. The role requires members to be involved in all aspects of
    running and maintaining our gallery; this includes (but is not limited to)
    devising and delivering our annual programme of exhibitions, events and
    workshops, sourcing funding for these activities and making them happen!
</p>
<p>
    While we aren’t looking for individuals with specific artist-run initiative
    experience, we are keen to hear from people who are personable,
    enthusiastic and can help contribute to, and shape EMBASSY.
</p>
<p>
    We would like to emphasise that these are not paid roles, as such we are
    not soliciting CVs or artist statements from those who wish to apply,
    rather we would like for you to send us either, a short written expression
    of interest (150 words maximum) or a video / alternative media if you
    prefer. We ask that this expression states the reasons for why you would
    like to join the committee and your interest in being a part of our
    artist-led organisation.
</p>
<p>
    From these submissions we will then develop a short list of people to come
    meet with us individually, discussing further their experiences and
    interest in becoming a part of the committee.
</p>
<p>
    We apologise in advance but we unfortunately are unable to take on members
    who are currently in full time education.

    <strong>AAS International Craft Symposium Call for Papers</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Deadline: September</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Applied Arts Scotland
</p>
<p>
    Proposals invited from makers curators, historians, theorists and
    researchers for AAS International Symposium ‘Old stories, new narratives:
    sustainability, identity and collaboration’
</p>
<p>
    Old stories, new narratives responds to the following questions:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    1. What does it mean to be a maker in a globally connected world?
</p>
<p>
    2. Is craft an antidote for some of the issues regarding sustainability?
    <br/>
    3. What impact does the current focus on climate change have in terms of
    material and production choices, business models, social, community
    enterprise and ethical consumption?
    <br/>
    4. How can cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary collaboration inform
    long-standing values associated with contemporary craft practice and
    innovation?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Old stories, new narratives  will provide an opportunity to share new ideas
    about practice, research-in-progress and case studies concerning both
    maker-led and theoretical strategies geared towards thinking about the
    future of making practices and process and what these might have to offer
    in a global context.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The one day symposium at Lyth Arts Centre seeks to celebrate the diversity
    of craft practice and the positive value of sharing knowledge and
    collaboration. Sessions intend to provoke and stimulate discussion by
    asking an array of critical questions about the values we invest in craft
    and how these values represent who we are, how we are seen and what craft
    can change.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The Symposium is flanked by the private view of the Meet, Make, Collaborate
    international craft exhibition on 22nd October at Thurso Art Gallery and
    skills sharing workshops on Friday 3 July with Scottish and international
    makers. All activity investigates themes of sustainability, identity and
    collaboration and draws on a range of recent international collaborations.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The Symposium will provide an opportunity to share new ideas about
    practice, research-in-progress or to present a case study concerning the
    future of making practices and process and what these might have to offer
    in a global context. The symposium intends to provoke and stimulate
    discussion by asking an array of questions about the values we invest in
    craft and how these values represent who we are, how we are seen and what
    craft can change.
    <br/>
    We invite proposals from makers across all fields of craft practice; also
    from curators; historians; theorists and researchers. We ask for
    contributors to respond to one of the above questions relating to the
    Symposium’s themes. Please email a 200-word abstract (for a 20-minute
    paper), along with a short biography to

    Anna Löbner Glasgow/Düsseldorf exchange 2021.
</p>
<p>
    The artist Anna Löbner was based at our Hanson Street studios and sadly

    exchange in her home town and it has gone from strength to strength ever
    since. The successful artist will spend early October to early December in
    Düsseldorf, Germany. On arriving, you will meet a representative from the
    Kulturamt der Landeshauptstadt (Düsseldorf’s city council) who will

    An exhibition will be arranged towards the end of your stay in the city run
    gallery Atelier Am Eck on 21st November 2021. Kulturamt der
    Landeshauptstadt will support you in the delivery of this exhibition
    including organisation hospitality and printing invitation cards for the
    opening night.

    of the city in Düsseldorf. Bilk is close to local amenities and on a direct
    train line to the city. A bicycle is also included for you to get around
    the city. The live-work studio is in a protected historic building, ran by
    the Kulturamt Der Landeshauptstadt (Cultural Administration), which houses
    many other artists. Living and work space are connected and cover 123
    square metres. The studio offers ideal working conditions for artists of
    all genres. This live work space is based within the eaves of the building,
    with exposed wooden beams, great natural light and a high ceiling height.
    The living space is open plan, with a sleeping space (2 beds) at mezzanine
    level. There is also a fully equipped kitchen, dining table and living room

    <li>
        Provide an artist with time, freedom and support to develop their
        practice.
    </li>
    <li>
        Facilitate exposure to a new arts scene and different practices as well
        as to new galleries and museum collections.
    </li>

    Fire Island Artist Residency
</p>
<p>
    The first program in the United States for emerging LGBTQ Visual Artists.
</p>
<p>
    Fire Island Artist Residency (FIAR), the first residency in the United
    States exclusively for artists identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual,
    transgender or queer, is now accepting applications for its prestigious and
    internationally recognized summer program. Now in its seventh season in the
    secluded community of Cherry Grove, NY, an historic LGBTQ settlement of
    Fire Island, five emerging artists will share a live/work space for a
    four-week program marked by intimate studio visits with, and public
    lectures by, renowned leaders in contemporary art and curation.
</p>
<p>
    In this way, FIAR hopes to bring both new creative perspectives and
    prestigious art professionals together in this extraordinary location to
    foster the creation—and preservation—of queer art-making in contemporary
    art.
</p>
<p>
    Currently, FIAR occupies rented beach house properties which are modestly
    converted into live/work spaces which include outdoor space for artists
    working with materials requiring ventilation as well as a small selection
    of hand tools such as drills. Artists are encouraged to bring additional
    equipment that they are already familiar using and can transport safely to
    Fire Island via ferry service/shipped. FIAR is led under the mentorship of
    acclaimed artist AA Bronson.

</p>
<p>
    GRADJOB is a collaboratively produced learning and un-professional practice
    programme which aims to support recent graduates across eight months.
</p>
<p>
    GRADJOB, in its third iteration, aims to reach graduates working across a
    range of disciplines and varied artistic approaches, across Scotland, to
    build a useful and supportive dialogue and resource.
</p>
<p>
    The programme will begin in April 2021 and the curriculum will be based
    around six intensive weekend gatherings. These sessions will focus on
    graduate needs within Scotland today. The programme was designed based on
    the feedback of previous participants and new GRADS will have the
    opportunity to shape the programme throughout.
</p>
<p>
    Regrettably, GRADJOB emerged from the lack of support, exploitation, and
    precarious working conditions experienced by emerging artists currently
    working in Scotland. It aims to offer support and inspiration to artists
    and organisers in the early stages of their career and who are in need of
    practical advice about how to survive, thrive, and develop their practice.
    GRADJOB celebrates learning how to: create opportunities, keep going, EAT
    LUNCH TOGETHER, write applications, MAKE TIME, build audiences, work
    collectively, make your own art world, SAY NO, juggle things, make friends,
    MESS IT UP, stay confident and grounded, find spaces, expand networks and
    be proactive!
</p>
<p>
    The selected residents will work collaboratively throughout the programme,
    along with invited educators, artists and organisations. Sessions will take
    the form of workshops, events, discussions, meals, screenings and trips.
</p>
<p>
    Graduates selected for GRADJOB will be expected to commit to full
    involvement in and engagement with all aspects of the programme, which will
    run from April through October 2021. Participants must commit to at least 5
    sessions out of 6. Please do not apply if you cannot commit to
    participating fully.
</p>
<p>
    We are looking for applicants who are ambitious, open, questioning, and
    supportive of others. Applicants must be keen to explore practical and
    inspiring ideas which contribute to the development and sustainability of
    projects, careers and communities.

    The Maker Foundation was established in 1980, and has been supporting
    experimental visual arts practitioners for the last 40 years through the
    Annual Art Prize. These prizes have enabled artists to create new work,
    purchase needed materials and pay for studio rent. Past recipients of the
    Annual Art Prize acknowledge their critical impact in allowing concentrated
    time for studio work, and in preparing for exhibitions and other
    professional opportunities such as accepting residencies. This year marks
    our 40th anniversary, and has been especially prescient given the collapse
    of other notable arts prizes. As such we have increased the prize fund to
    £7,500.
</p>
<p>
    The prize will awarded in November at the Annual Art Prize ceremony in
    London with our partners, who continue to be strong patrons for the arts.
    There is no disciplinary criteria for this award, we are primarily looking
    for artists of outstanding skills, craft and talent, in whichever medium
    you work in. If you believe you are eligible, please check the criteria on
    our website at

</p>
<p>
    Surgeon’s Hall Museums, in partnership with the Leverhulme Trust, is
    looking for a resident artist to be part of the re-hang of the anatomy room
    in 2020.
</p>
<p>
    Surgeons’ Hall Museums reopened in 2015 after a major £4.4 million Heritage
    Lottery Funded redevelopment project. As one of the oldest Museums in
    Scotland, the collections grew from 1720 after 'natural and artificial
    curiosities' were publicly sought, with the Playfair Building opening in
    1832 to house the Barclay and Bell collections. Whilst the Museums were
    initially established as a medical teaching resource, all are now welcome
    to visit. In November 2021, 300 years since the collection began, we will
    be re-hanging the anatomy room to investigate what the previously
    understood binary of ‘natural and artificial’ means now in the 21st
    century.
</p>
<p>
    The Museums, with support from the Leverhulme Trust, would like to welcome
    applications for the position of artist in residence, who will be involved
    in the museum’s research and selection processes. We can offer a fee of
    £2,500 towards the commissioning of a new work to take the position of a
    curiosity, as well as access to the University of Edinburgh’s biology and
    medical departments.

        Research Consultancy: Mapping Abbeyhill and Dumbiedykes Regeneration
        Projects
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Deadline: January</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Edinburgh University
</p>
<p>
    Mapping Abbeyhill and Dumbiedykes Regeneration Projects
</p>
<p>
    In this ever-changing global landscape, we believe regeneration is integral
    to the sustainability and growth of the city of Edinburgh, as well as to
    balanced societies. As the city transforms to host an ever increasing
    temporary August population, it is crucial that we re-assess the efficient
    use of central city space, and it’s potential for supporting this continued
    tourism. A mapping of the two development projects underway in Abbeyhill
    and Dumbiedykes is a hugely beneficial exercise in assessing the value of
    the ecosystem and the positive impacts the regeneration is having on the
    neighbourhoods.
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of this mapping report is to build an up-to-date overview of
    the areas, and network of its local citizens. The report will help
    facilitate an understanding of the progress and change of the regeneration
    schemes as they advance over the years and will be an invaluable resource
    of information for the university as it moves to direct further resources
    to other areas around Edinburgh.
</p>
<p>
    Eligible applicants must be a respected researcher in the fields of urban
    development, or a creative professional working in Scotland.
</p>
<p>
    The applicants must have in-depth knowledge of the cultural landscape of
    Edinburgh; some established connections with organisations and key
    stakeholders in Dumbiedykes and Abbeyhill; and experience in conducting
    mappings and research in the creative field and civic regeneration. A
    stipend fee of £4,500 is available for this work.

    <strong>Open Call for an Embedded Artist</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Deadline: February</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Scottish Government
</p>
<p>
    This is an exciting, paid opportunity for an artist or cultural
    practitioner interested in exploring the role the arts can play in shaping
    how our society and politics operate.
</p>
<p>
    An Embedded Artist works within non-arts institutions to bring different
    ways of thinking and working to bear on challenging projects and creatively
    solve systemic problems within local government and established
    institutions, generating new, creative perspectives when tackling concerns
    faced by these organisations.
</p>
<p>
    We are looking for an artist or cultural practitioner working in any art
    form to make use of their relatively autonomous position as an ‘outsider’
    to help to provide new ways of thinking, fresh perspectives and different
    approaches to the challenges facing society, specifically within the
    context of Scotland.
</p>
<p>
    The anticipated total time commitment is around 28 days spread over the
    whole project (April 2021 - September 2021) with a fee of £7,500. This
    includes time spent attending meetings in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee, and
    Inverness, presenting at an international conference at the Scottish
    Parliament in Autumn 2021, and contributing to the online resource and
    toolkit which seeks to disseminate the learnings of the project.
</p>
<p>
    Applications cost 10% of your overall finances to submit, and this will
    help us cover staffing shortages to effectively manage the open call.
</p>
<p>
    A full Embedded Artist Brief can be found on our website, along with more
    details about the role, partner organisations and time commitments. The
    Scottish Government would like to thank the support of Freelands Foundation
    for their generous support.
